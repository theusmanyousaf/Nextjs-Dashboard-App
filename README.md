## Next.js Dashboard Application

This is a nextjs full stack dashboard application.

TechStack is Nextjs with Typescript and Tailwind for front-end. Nextjs for back-end PostgreSQL for database.

In this app I learned and used Nextjs14 concepts which include:

1. CSS Styling
2. Optimizing Fonts and Images
3. Layouts and Pages
4. Seamless Navigation between pages with Nextjs "<Link/>" tag
5. Setting up Database
6. Data fetching form the Database
7. Streaming {that breaks down data into smaller chunks and loads}
8. Search and Pagination
9. Mutating Data {with React server actions}
10. Handling Errors
11. Improving Accessibility
12. Authentication
